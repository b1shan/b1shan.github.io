### About Me
I build security products. Things that solve security problems. Like stop attackers, slow them down, or at least, detect them. Roughly speaking, make their lives difficult. 

My product philosophy is: security should be transparent. If that is not possible, it should add to developer productivity. At the very least, it should be highly usable. I am a big fan of simple systems. Simple systems not only happen to be scalable, but also highly maintainable and easier to operate.

Things I built run on several hundred thousands systems. I wear many hats. I write code, lead engineering teams, architect solutions, and work across org boundaries. Many a time, company-wide.
